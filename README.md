# MSDS-422-Assignment-2---Evaluating-Linear-Models
# Boston Housing Study

This project using SciKit Learn Machine Learning methods to determine the best fit for a linear model. The exercise uses the Boston housing data from: David A. Belsley, Edwin Kuh, and Roy E.Welsch. 'Regression Diagnostics: Identifying Influential Data and Sources of Collinearity.'
Background Materials

All explanatory variables (with the exception of neighborhood) and all 506 census tract observations from the Boston Housing Study.

# Response variables
(1) the median value of homes in thousands of 1970 dollars or 
(2) the log median value of homes in thousands of 1970 dollars

# The following regression methods were used for comparision.
linear regression
ridge regression
lasso regression
elastic net

# Evaluation
Evaluate these methods within a cross-validation design, using root mean-squared error (RMSE) as an index of prediction error.
Python Scikit Learn should be your primary environment for conducting this research.

# Management Questions to Answer
Advising a real estate brokerage firm in its attempt to employ machine learning methods. The firm wants to use machine learning to complement conventional methods for assessing the market value of residential real estate.

Of the modeling methods examined in your study, which would you recommend to management, and why?
